# Christmas Lights and Sounds Machine

This is the code that powers my [NodeBot's Day](http://nodebots.io/) project. I wanted to build something simple, mainly due to my inexperience with building circuitry. When assembled and run, and LED will flash red and green and a piezo will play something that resembles Jingle Bells.


## Hardware

 - Arduino UNO with Firmata flashed on it
 - Colour LED on pins 3, 5, and 6
 - Button on pin 2
 - Piezo on pin 9
